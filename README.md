## About

Creating and styling cards can be a chore. Especially if you're electing to use CSS and HTML5, strictly. Cards.css is a CSS library of cards that are easy to update.

Included in the collection are cards with dropdown extensions, varying text justifications (left, right, and center), and more. Each of the cards was created in the spirit of Material Design, and can be easily updated to fit your needs.

### To Use These Cards on Any Page

Visit the Demo Page and review the HTML code? Why?:

To make sure the cards render correctly, you'll need to know the HTML tags being used 
(such as h4, p, & div names), the structure of each card example.

After you make sure you've created the correct div's and patterned the content you want to add to the source code structure listed in the demo page, you are ready to include my
stylesheet!
